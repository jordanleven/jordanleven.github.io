# Jordan's Personal Website

Hello there! You may be wondering what this repository is for. Although my main website is located at [jordanleven.com], the exact same site is also available on GitHub at [jordanleven.github.io]. The files in this repository are automatically committed from the main repository with the source code whenever a new version of the site is released using GitHub Actions. While jordanleven.com is hosted on [AWS Amplify][aws_amplify_site], jordanleven.github.io is hosted on GitHub pages.
