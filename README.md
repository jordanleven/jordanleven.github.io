# Jordan's Personal Website

Hello there! You may be wondering what this repository is for. Although my main website is located at [jordanleven.com], the exact same site is also available on GitHub at [jordanleven.github.io]. This repository contains distribution files, not source code files. Whenever a new version of the site is released using [Standard Version], a GitHub Actions pipeline builds the distribution files and simultaneously deploys them to the production instance of [jordanleven.com] and commits them in this repository, making them available for [jordanleven.github.io]. While jordanleven.com is hosted on [Netlify][netlify], jordanleven.github.io is hosted on GitHub pages.

## Changes

All changes are available via the [changelog]. While you won't be able to see the exact contents of individual commits, you are still able to view the commit messages and release versions.
