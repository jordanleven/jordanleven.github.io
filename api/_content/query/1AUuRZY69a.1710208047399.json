Inspired by Sparkbox's Gem Me Bot, Reaction Bot is a configurable Slack app designed to run in Slack channels and capture various reactions to messages and post them to specified channels. Just register a list of emoji reactions to listen for and specify the channel to post in, and you're ready to go! Once running, Reaction Bot automatically listens for reactions using Slack's WebSocket and Events API.","projectDate":"2022-03-06T05:00:00.000Z","postDate":"2022-03-06T05:00:00.000Z","backgroundImage":"/images/projects/reaction-bot/reaction-bot-background.jpg","screenshotImage":"/images/projects/reaction-bot/reaction-bot-hero.jpg","shortIntro":true,"summary":"An installable Slack app designed to capture reactions to messages.","thumbnail":"/images/projects/reaction-bot/reaction-bot-hero.jpg","projectUrl":"https://github.com/jordanleven/reaction-bot","photoGallery":[{"image":"/images/projects/reaction-bot/gallery/reaction-bot-1.jpg"},{"image":"/images/projects/reaction-bot/gallery/reaction-bot-2.jpg"}],"quote":"One of my favorite things about Jordan is how he brings joy to his daily work.
