It accomplishes this by leveraging data provided by public APIs from both platforms. It calculates billable expectations based on the user's starting time and the hours they've billed. Throughout the day, the status and estimated end-of-day progress are automatically recalculated based on real-time progress towards billable expectations set in Forecast. Breakdowns include expected and actual hours by type (billable and non-billable) and by individual project.","projectDate":"2022-04-27T00:00:00-05:00","postDate":"2022-04-27T00:00:00-05:00","backgroundImage":"/images/projects/billables-buddy/billables-buddy-background.jpg","screenshotImage":"/images/projects/billables-buddy/hero.png","shortIntro":true,"featured":false,"summary":"A small but powerful xbar applet to keep track of billable expectations via Forecast and Harvest APIs.","thumbnail":"/images/projects/billables-buddy/thumbnail.jpeg","projectUrl":"https://github.com/jordanleven/billables-buddy","photoGallery":[{"image":"/images/projects/billables-buddy/gallery/billables-buddy-1.jpg"},{"image":"/images/projects/billables-buddy/gallery/billables-buddy-2.jpg"},{"image":"/images/projects/billables-buddy/gallery/billables-buddy-3.jpg"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Billables Buddy was created out of a simple necessity: to help monitor your progress towards billable expectations when using "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.forecast.app/","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Forecast"}]},{"type":"text","value":" for scheduling and "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://getharvest.com","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Harvest"}]},{"type":"text","value":" for time tracking.
