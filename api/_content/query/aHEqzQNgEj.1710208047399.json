Instead of using images, animated circles and parallelograms were coded for performance and fidelity. While using images for various shapes is simpler, coding them provides greater flexibility with animations and ensures clarity on high-resolution displays. Another example of this attention to quality concerns animations, which are triggered using the IntersectionObserver API for scroll-based animations as the user scrolls down the page. This has a performance boost instead of the traditional approach of binding scroll events on the entire document. Despite the time-consuming nature, both pages were engineered within a week."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:projects:bicentennial-scholars-fund.md","_source":"content","_file":"projects/bicentennial-scholars-fund.md","_extension":"md"}
